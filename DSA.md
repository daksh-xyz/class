## INTRODUCTION TO Data Structures
### What is DSA ?
    A data structure is a way to store and organize data
    in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently  

### LIST : (ADT)
 - A list can store a given number of elemnts of any type.
 - Read elements by position .
 - Modify elements at a position.

<mark> Meanwhile, arrays are a concrete implementation which can  store data of a given type (homogeneous), and are assigned storage at compile time.</mark>

### Linked List : (Discussed later)

### Abstract Data Types (ADT) :
 define data and operations, but no implementation...  
 we will study : 
 1. Logical view
 1. Operations
 1. cost of operations
 1. Implementation

### Types of Data Structures : 
- Arrays
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph etc...

## List as abstract Data Type
 

## Doubly Linked list:
